A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jPeQJR.

 CSS animated version of [this beautiful pen](http://codepen.io/pixelass/pen/rVqvXY/) by [Gregor Adams](http://codepen.io/pixelass/).

All glitchy in Firefox (wrong paint order, pls fix mr firefox) ! Can't figure how to fix it (if you can, tell me).

(Also not in IE because no `preserve-3d` support)

Forked from [Bali Balo](http://codepen.io/bali_balo/)'s Pen [Animated hexinhex](http://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/vOVrJB/).
